# Personal Resume/Cover Letter Repository

This is a repository to work on my resumes and cover letters.
Resume will be posted frequently, but cover letters most of the time cover letters will not be posted.

Based on the [Awesome-CV template](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV), layouts, items, and code structure have been modified.


## How to Use

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ xelatex {your-cv}.tex
```

This should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf``
